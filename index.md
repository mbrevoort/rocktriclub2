    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Swim, Bike, Run.</p>
    <p>Camaraderie, Support, Enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>The Rock Tri Club will give you all of that and so much more. We have athletes of every age in one sport or in many. We have athletes that compete in one race a season, in ten races a season, and some athletes that just love to support and not compete.</p>
    <p>We are a motivating and enthusiastic group of athletes that love to share experiences and ideas that revolve not only on an individual basis but around families and children as well!</p>
    <p>Come to one of our workouts and say hi! (If someone from the club doesn't beat you to it!)</p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
