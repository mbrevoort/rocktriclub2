The Rock Tri Club was organized and created to benefit its members in the sports of triathlon, duathlon, and their collective components of swimming, biking, and running. Being a member of our club means that you'll be surrounded by a supportive network to encourage you and spur you on toward your goals.

We are a positive group that thrives on improving as a whole. We believe that wellness is contagious, so it is our mission to share our love for the outdoors and fitness. As a member of our club, you will also become part of a community that receives discounts and services from local sponsors. Our sponsors believe in us and treat us well; we promise to make them proud. Let's TRI together!
