Welcome to Rock Tri Club 2015! What’s new at RTC? Our logo, our website, many new activities, but our mission remains the same. 

Join our 2015 Kick Off Meeting THIS Saturday from 3-5pm at Carlos Miguels. What is the best way to start the year? With a plan. Join us as Jessie Kenny walks us through how to build a real plan to achieve our goals. Join us by RSVPing here: https://ti.to/rock-tri-club/2015-year-kick-off

Next up, an area of uncertainty for many is nutrition. Andrew Dole, a member of our team and a dietician has offered to answer our questions and lead a nutrition seminar. On January 25th, join us as we learn how to best fuel our bodies. Andrew wants to know what we want to know. Look for a survey soon. Be thinking of your nutrition questions and look for your RSVP. 

Our new club website is up. The sign up for membership is clean and smooth! We will begin  collecting membership dues on January 10th. Also on the website is our schedule of workouts, a news section, and a workout section. We will continue to add swim and strength workouts to the site. If you can’t make a group workout, you will have access to some great workouts to do solo or with a few friends. Check out the new site now! http://rocktriclub.com

As always, it’s easy to connect through Facebook, our group is here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/rocktriclub/

And we have a Strava Group to collect our workouts and cheer one another on. Strava is a great FREE app to track all your workouts. Check it out and join us here: http://www.strava.com/clubs/rocktriclub

We will be having our 4th Annual Rock Swim Meet on February 8th at the Castle Rock Rec Center. If you have not swam in a meet since middle school (or never), this is a thrilling way to challenge yourself in the offseason. All abilities are welcome and encouraged to participate. You can sign up here: https://ti.to/rock-tri-club/rock-classic-2015

Finally, we are partnering with 6202, our local cycling club. Every member will be invited to join the 6202 rides without additional membership fees. Rock Tri Club will be partnering with them to help develop new riders and strengthen our female member participation. If you are a female, we will be gathering in February to discuss how to make our cycling component stronger. We need your help! 

What is our mission? Swim, Bike, Run. Camaraderie, Support, Enthusiasm. We welcome all ages, all abilities to join with us as motivate one another. From age group winners, to our first timers, to our cheering section. Participate in one sport or all of them, we want to cheer with you as you accomplish your goals. 

We look forward to seeing you a workout soon!
