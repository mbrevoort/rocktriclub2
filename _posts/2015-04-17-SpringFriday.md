Quote: It's a slow process, but quitting won't speed it up. 

If you've been around the club for a while, you know that Tara McFarlin has been busting her butt. Well, she qualified for the Boston Marathon and is leaving today for Boston! Tara is so mentally and physically strong. I feel privileged just to get to watch her improve year over year, race after race. We wish Tara the best this weekend- she's worked hard and it will pay off!

The young phenom (Missy Franklin) is just beginning her career and is saddled with mile-high expectations; the veteran (Kara Lynn Joyce) is trying to rediscover the juice that took her the previous two Olympics. Touch the Wall is a story of winning and losing, of commitment, and triumph through adversity. Itâ€™s also a story of family, of loving what you do, and having fun with the people around you."
